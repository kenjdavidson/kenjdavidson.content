I love golf; but I've been falling out of love with my [Garmin Approach S4](https://www.fitbit.com/global/no/products/smartwatches/ionic). It may not have helped that since I got my [Fitbit Ionic](https://www.fitbit.com/global/no/products/smartwatches/ionic) I haven't taken it off. The one missing feature on the Fitbit is the lack of Golf app!

The top choice seems to be [Smart Watch Golf GPS](http://localhost:8000/) although it was mising some features I wanted, and when I attempted to become a contributor I never heard back. 

Enter [Caddieasy](https://www.kenjdavidson.com/caddieasy).
