While developing [Standardbred Canada](https://www.standardbredcanada.ca) mobile application I was required to write (well I guess I could have not used React Native) a plugin that provided Bluetooth Classic functionality to both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.standardbredmobileapp&hl=en_CA&gl=US) and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/standardbred-canada-mobile/id1476739891). There were numerous plugins for Android, but most of them fell back to BLE for their IOS implementations. Starting with the great base of [React Native Bluetooth Serial](https://github.com/rusel1989/react-native-bluetooth-serial) I was able to get External Accessory up and running for IOS.
