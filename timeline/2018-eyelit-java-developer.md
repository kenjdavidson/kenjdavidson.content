I finally crossed the line from support/analyst to full time developer, working with custom development used in the integration of Eyelit MES to client environments. This included, but was not limited to, custom communication modules using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/),[SECS/Gem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECS/GEM), plain old REST over HTTP (along with some others). Some other interesting projects I was included on:

- Designing initial development of the new MES Web Portal in AngularJS. This has since been re-written in Angular 8 by **Lynn Chen** (a solid Jr Developer that I wish I could link to).
- Assist and mentored [Emmanuel Sekoh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/e2sekoh/) on the **SECS/GEM** MES integration.
- Initial research and development of a [Java based MSMQ](https://github.com/kenjdavidson/msmq4j) library.
- Selection and integration of a static code checking solution (contractor)

More importantly, this was my first interaction with AngularJS - late to the game I know - but still where my interest in "full stack" technology started.
