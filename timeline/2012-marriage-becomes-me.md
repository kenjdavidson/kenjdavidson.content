Marriage, it's pretty crazy. At first you're like _"no way will I do that"_ and then you're like _"ok, this seems like a pretty solid plan"_ and then your crazy starts to rub off on each other and you're walking around the house peaking around corners because:

- She knows you hate being scared!
- You know she loves to scare you!

Marriage, man - she'll get ya.
