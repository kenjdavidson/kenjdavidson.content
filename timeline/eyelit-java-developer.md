I finally crossed the line from support/analyst to full time developer - primarily writing custom server side integration functionality using a combination of [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), [SECS/Gem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECS/GEM), plain old REST over HTTP (along with some others). This was also where I was introduced to AngularJS (let to the game I know), where I was tasked with designing and developing the new Web portal from the ground up.

Pretty much starting me on my _full stack_ development journey.
