Standardbred Canada was nearing the end of their legacy migration to web services, I was brought on to start phasing out the vendor development company. My primary responsiblities were the design and development of the remaining legacy modules from **Basic** to a **Java** (`RESTEasy`/`Tomcat` backed `AngularJS` webapp).

I've been able to work on a number of interesting projects:

- I was able to spearhead the development and release of the Standardbred Mobile bluetooth scanning app for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.standardbredmobileapp&hl=en_CA) and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/standardbred-canada-mobile/id1476739891), using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). I've slowly been documenting the design and development process in a [series of articles](/writing/2020/01/03/designing-my-first-app-part-1/).
