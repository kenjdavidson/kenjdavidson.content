The operations team was responsible for customer review, development and implementation. I was asked to make the switch in order to provide a younger team with guidence on their processes. I was also responsible for taking over any long running 'dog' projects or projects for higher profile customers.

I also started working more closely with the product managers with regards to updating the design and technology backing the Web and IVR software. We were also starting to design a new fixed route and paratransit mobile app - which I had the opportunity to help design and develop.
