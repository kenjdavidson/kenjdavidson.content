When I started at Trapeze for '03 I was the brought on as the first permanent support role (previously it had been rotated through by the Operations team). The team on which I worked was responsible for supporting the **Web**, **IVR** and all external customer communication software throughout the transit industry.

Over time my responsiblities started to expand:

- I was brought in on new product development and design.
- I was responsible for creating and presenting new product and training sessions at the yearly users conference.
- I started performing some bug/enhancement development to offload work from the development team.
