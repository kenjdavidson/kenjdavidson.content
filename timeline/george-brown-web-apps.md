I chose to start working my way through [Commercial Web Application Program](https://coned.georgebrown.ca/courses-and-programs/commercial-web-application-development-program) before Covid started, in order to get some experience with `C#`:

- [COMP 9571 Foundations of Application Development](https://coned.georgebrown.ca/courses-and-programs/foundations-of-application-development-distance-learning)
- [COMP 9572 Web Application Development and Design](https://coned.georgebrown.ca/courses-and-programs/web-application-development-and-design-distance-learning)
- [COMP 9582 Web Application Data Services](https://coned.georgebrown.ca/courses-and-programs/web-application-data-services-distance-learning)

And am waiting until the remaining course is updated to the latest Microsoft technology:

- [COMP 9585 Web Application Development for Commercial Websites](https://coned.georgebrown.ca/courses-and-programs/web-application-development-for-commercial-websites)
