Standardbred Canada was nearing the end of their legacy migration to web services, I was brought on to start phasing out the vendor development company.  My primary responsiblities were the design and development of the remaining legacy modules from Basic to a Java backed AngularJS web app.

As it goes with a smaller company, you generally have your hands into a wider array of projects.  Because of this, I was able to spearhead the development and release of the Standardbred Mobile bluetooth scanning app for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.standardbredmobileapp&hl=en_CA) and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/standardbred-canada-mobile/id1476739891), using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
