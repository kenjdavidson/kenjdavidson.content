Eventually, I was asked to transition to the Operations team. My experience in working with customers and development allowed me to assist in training new hires and transitioning new projects. On top of this, I was responsible for handling some of the longer running and over budget projects - my ability to quickly discuss, document and developm (changes) allowed me to close these projects off more quickly than going through the regular process.

I also started working more closely with the product managers with regards to updating the design and technology backing the **Web**, **IVR** and **Mobile Application**.
