Thanks for swinging by - if you're looking to get in touch you've got the following options

## Shoot an Email

Probably the best way to get a hold of me is to toss me an [email](mailto:ken.j.davidson@live.ca).  If it gets through to my phone I'll do my best to get back to you within the day.

## Linked In Me

If this is related to work or employment (or anything I guess now) feel free to connect with me on linked in [@kenjdavidson](https://linkedin.com/kenjdavidson).

## Follow My Github

I try to post anything I'm currently working on at [https://github.com/kenjdavidson](https://github.com/kenjdavidson).  This will include:

- Projects
- Online Courses
- Random things I need to save

## Social Media

I'm not the biggest social media fan:

- [@kenjdavidson](https://instagram.com/kenjdavidson) on Instagram (which only exists for providing grandparents with photos of Carson and maybe binge watching some golf reels)
