Thanks for swinging by - if you're looking to get in touch you've got a couple of options.   

Regardless of what you're looking for: assistance with [Bluetooth Classic](https://kenjdavidson.com/react-native-bluetooth-classic); a role you're head hunting for; or maybe a custom project you're looking to start; I do my best to respond to anything not in my Junk folder within the day (24ish hours).

> At this point in time I'm not on the market for a new role, but I appreciate your interest if that's how you ended up here.

<Title text="Shoot me an Email" />

Probably the best way to get a hold of me is to toss me an [email](mailto:ken.j.davidson@live.ca).  If it gets through to my phone I'll do my best to get back to you within the day.

<Title text="Linked In"/>

I'm not overly active on Linked In - but it's a pretty good (and consistently updated) reference for my professional experience.  Feel free to connect with me [@kenjdavidson](https://linkedin.com/kenjdavidson) if you'd like to work together on something.
