So, I'm Ken. I'm not a big enough deal (nor trust any of my friends) to have someone write me a biography!  To get through this quickly and to my level of writing, let me provide you with the _communication of the Gods_ (a.k.a point form)!!

<Title text="Husbanding & Fathering" />

- I'm Married to a wonderfully amazing (and more importantly patient) woman, Sue.  
- We've been together/married for north of 10 years; don't ask me to get into the specifics - it's just all been so amazing that I can't keep track of time!
- We've got a crazy and energetic (my doppleganger of a) son, Carson.  
- I never thought I'd be patient enough to be a father and to be honest some days I don't think I'll ever be; but I do my absolute best and think it's going well so far.
- We try to be outside as much as possible during (all year round); watching Carson scoot around the block with his friends, checking out [Halton's conservation areas](https://www.conservationhalton.ca/parks), building a luge track on the front lawn, or any number of other ridiculous things we find ourselves doing.
- When we're inside we're in _other room_ (literally just the room adjacent to the TV room) making money playing **Axe Ball**.

<Title text="Golfing"/>

- I played baseball through my youth and didn't actually get into Golf until my mid twenties.
- Even with ~20 years under my belt, I'm still pretty terrible (14 handicap).
- I try to play two times a week (sprinkling in that third whenever the opportunity presents itself).
- If you're a bogey golfer, feel free to hit me up for some loonie skins around the GTA.
- What's in the bag? Callaway Rogue Driver/3 Wood, Cobra King Max 4i-GW, 56, 60

<Title text="Developing"/>

- I graduated from [Ryerson University](https://ryerson.ca) with a degree in [Computer Science](https://www.ryerson.ca/programs/undergraduate/computer-science/).
- I went through a string of non-development [roles](https://linkedin.com/kenjdavidson) including sales, support, implementation and design before getting back into the development game.  
- I'm currently working at Guidwire Software as a Senior Software Engineer.  The main technologies I work with are `Java`, `Kotlin`, `React` on `Spring Boot`.
- My first attempt at playing with React Native ended up in a releasing and maintaining the [React Native Bluetooth Classic](https://kenjdavidson.com/react-native-bluetooth-classic) library.  It's been an interesting ride; I've been able to help out a bunch of university/college kids working on a number of final projects.
- I'm always attempting to work my way through new languages and framworks.  The flavour de jour is [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) which I wasn't expecting to like/be as interest in as I find myself.
