There's nothing I love more than just falling down the [rabbit hole](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rabbit%20hole) which is the Internet. Whether it's researching:

- technology
- golf
- health & fitness
- illness and symptoms (you know you do it)

or anything else that might pop into my mind; there are a lot of people who know so much about their respective fields that you can only be in awe of them.

Please check out some of them when you have time.

## Technology

Whether it's for work, a personal project, or just me wanting to get some practice with a new framework that seems interesting, the following sites are where I go when I've issues or questions:

### Java

- [Jenkov Tutorials](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/) is one of the defacto places to go for all things Java.
- [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/), primarily provide [Spring](https://spring.io/) tutorials, but also have a bunch of other content that gold.

### Front End

I've been slowly getting into more and more front end work, primarily [AngularJS]() and [React]():

- [Mozilla Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) is a definite must for anything web related.
- [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) is another one stop shop for everything good.
- [Medium](https://medium.com/) - except for when my monthly reads are up.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) is also a must.
- [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) is a wizard.
- [Kamram Ayub](https://kamranicus.com/) this was solid _rabbit hole_ find, still going through a bunch of his articles.
- [JS Ramblings](https://jsramblings.com/)

### DevOps

- [Factory 127](https://factory127.com/) is one of my good buddy's consulting company. When it comes to DevOps he's my general goto.
