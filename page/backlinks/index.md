There's nothing I love more than just falling down the [rabbit hole](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rabbit%20hole) which is the Internet. Whether it's researching:

- technology
- golf
- health & fitness
- illness and symptoms (you know you do it)

or anything else that might pop into my mind; there are a lot of people who know so much about their respective fields that you can only be in awe of them.

Please check out some of them when you have time.
