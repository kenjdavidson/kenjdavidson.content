So, I get that **2018** seems like an odd time to have a **first personal website**.

I'll be completely honest, I never really saw the point. Prior to 2018 I was working either in a support or analyst role and doing development on the side was done for my own personal interest when I had time; the thought of forcing myself to start writing about the things I've done or learned (when I could be outside or doing offline things) just didn't seem like a good idea for me.

Fast forward to **2018** it started to become apparent that regardless of how much I dislike blogging - it's a necessary evil in this industry. I've always been a pretty anxious person, and that's probably rolled into the thought of

> Who actually wants to read something I've written?

or probably more accurate

> There are way smarter people and way better writers out there creating things I could never think of.

Regardless of those feelings though, I've been doing my best to get content out every once in a while when I come across/resolve an issue that has taken a few days of _Googling_ and code reviewing that will hopefully save someone the heartache.

Enjoy.
