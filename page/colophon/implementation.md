As mentioned before, this site is (and always will be) a work in progress.  Things will be broken, missing, probably doing some funky things; for which I apologize.

The current implementation of the site is based upon:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) cause they are awesome and as new to them as I am, I'm hooked.
- Hosted on [Gitub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as all great seem to be.
- Styled using [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/), a React based library that (doesn't mesh 100% with Gatsby) provides some unique and useful functionality.  

#### Grommet

I'll be completely honest - it looked cool and I do really like the library.  But after getting a little more of it under my belt, I think that it was a bit much for my personal site.  There are a few things like:

- Theming
- Responsiveness (a bigger one)
- and some other things

That I've needed to work around (most likely in not the best way) in order to get things how I prefer them.
