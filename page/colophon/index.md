First off - I definitely don't fancy myself a designer, as you can probably tell from the terrible colour choices and lack of imagery. There are a lot of people out there that make a lot more beautiful things that I! (so if you've got hints toss them my way).

I use this site as a play ground for working with different languages, frameworks and technology. You may also come across this site if you've followed the **Ken davidson** rabbit hole that is the internet - if that's the case - welcome.

I've seen a lot of these [colophon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)>) pages pop up to describe how and why sites were designed the way they were, figured I'd just on the bandwagon.
