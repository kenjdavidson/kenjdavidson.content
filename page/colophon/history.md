This site has seen many iterations.  Sadly, I didn't have the foresight to include previous versions and make them available here.  At any rate, there is a brief history:

### 2020 Github & Gatsby

Around the same time I had started playing with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/); although JavaScript has never been my favorite, I really started appreciating it and wanting to use it more.  Following the rabbit hole, that is the Internet, it quickly became apparent that [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) was the next thing I had to get my hands on (the Lord of the Rings reference definitely didn't hurt).

While working through the theming process I decided to give my own a shot (again, I don't know why I don't learn) with the following:

- [Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/)/[Typography Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-typography/) as it provided pretty solid and well documented functionality.
- [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) and [Merriweather Light](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) Google fonts.
- [FontAwesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/) for the obvious.

Another chance to pad the [articles](https://www.kenjdavidson.com/writing/2020/03/01/here-comes-gatsby/).

### 2019 Github & Jekyll

In 2019 I decided that I spent enough money on GoDaddy and enough time trying to get into PHP; so it was time for a change!  I had been reading about [Gitub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/); I figured like it would be a solid (and free - although I current subscribe for Github now anyhow) choice.  This time I decided not to try and play around with my own theme - I ended up choosing a plain little theme [Lagom](https://github.com/swanson/lagom) by [Matt Swanson](https://mdswanson.com/).

I was pretty happy but needed a little bit more out of it:

- On mobile devices there was no menu access (problematic)
- It wasn't built for a large number of pages

So the added functionality got added in [Lagomier](https://github.com/kenjdavidson/jekyll-lagomier), sadly [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) wasn't long for this world.

Here's an [article](https://www.kenjdavidson.com/writing/2019/05/28/from-wordpress-to-github-pages/) about it.

### Pre 2018 GoDaddy & Wordpress

My first personal website (we'll leave [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) and [MySpace](https://myspace.com/) out of it) was a [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.com) site hosted on [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.ca).   This site was (imagine this) pretty much the same layout this bad boy is now (the sidebar menu with 1/3 split, if that's still what it is); using a theme that I had attempted to build myself using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).  My lack of design skills coupled with my distain for **PHP** made it not very pretty, and me not very active.  

I was able to continue to use it while playing around attmepting to grow my enjoyment of **PHP** (which got a little better, but I still wouldn't call it love).  The main project that came out of Wordpress and PHP was my [Yahoo! Fantasy Sports Wordpress](https://github.com/kenjdavidson/yahoo-fantasy-wordpress) plugin.
