Icons are provided by:

- Standard [Grommet Icons](https://icons.grommet.io/).
- Hand Symbol Icons made by [Vitaly Gorbachev](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/vitaly-gorbachev) from [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
- Social Icons made by [Pixel Perfect](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/pixel-perfect) from [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

I'm currently working on getting the Flat Icons wrapped (webpack plugin) within the Grommet `<Blank/>` icon to provide the Grommet theme sizing to them throughout the site.
