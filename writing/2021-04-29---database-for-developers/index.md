I came across one of the best sets of videos, geared for developers in understanding and working with databases.  I fully realize my limitations when it comes to the DBA side of things - and those that have this knowledge are close to the _gods_ in my mind.  Hopefully if you come across this you give [Chris Saxon](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheMagicofSQL/about) a follow, as he definitely deserves it!!

## Blog Link(s)

He writes for the Oracle Developer blog (a quick Google) which I've started following as well:
